# Overview
[ExtractTable](https://extracttable.com) - **API to extract tabular data from images and scanned PDFs**

The motivation is to make it easy for developers to extract tabular data from images or scanned PDF files without worrying about the table area, column coordinates, rotation et al.

# Prerequisite

Before we talk/boast about the service, a developer MUST need an API key to use the ExtractTable service. [FREE credits here](https://extracttable.com/trail.html). 

We beat this market **not just in accuracy also in cost, and expiration**. You are most welcomed to [BUY credits here](https://extracttable.com/#pricing) or email me at saradhi@extracttable.com for assistance.


# Basic Usage
Ok, enough selling. Let the ease in coding do the talk, and the output encourages you to buy credits - put that timer on and count the LOC.

```python
from ExtractTable import ExtractTable
et_sess = ExtractTable(api_key=YOUR_API_KEY)        # Replace your VALID API Key here
print(et_sess.check_usage())        # Checks the API Key validity as well as shows associated plan usage 
table_data = et_sess.process_file(filepath=Location_of_Image_with_Tables, output_format="df")
```

### Woahh, as simple as that ?!

Its up to you now to explore the ways.
